 ### Lesson 8- Arrays
 
 - 1. Amend the code to create an array of characters on the stack, which contains your full name
 (including room for a space between your first and last names). Now create a function which
 prints to screen your name using the array you just created.

 - 2. Create two arrays on the heap called “first” and “last”. Copy your first name into the “first”
 array and your last name into the “last” array.

 - 3. Create a “battleship” game using a 2-dimension array of booleans to represent the battle-ground.
 Use appropriate dimensions (say 5 by 5) and denote the presence of your “battleship” by setting
 the boolean values to true in array indices where your battleship is situated. Provide the user
 with a certain number of guesses to pick coordinates within the 2-D array. Your program should
 keep track of the number of guesses made and inform the user whether a guess is successful or
 not.
