#### Lesson 3- Program Flow
 - 1. Write a function that accepts an integer argument and returns a boolean value. The function
 should return true if the integer argument is greater than or equal to zero, and false otherwise.
 Call this function with a positive and negative value to test that it works, using cout to display
 the result.
- 2. Write another function that continuously asks for numbers (use cin), until the user provides a
 negative number. You’ll need some kind of loop and you should make use of the function you
 created in Exercise 1.
- 3. Recursion is an alternative to writing loops where a function “calls itself”. Write another version
 of the factorial function that uses Recursion instead of loops. What is one advantage and one
 disadvantage of using Recursion as an alternative to loops?
