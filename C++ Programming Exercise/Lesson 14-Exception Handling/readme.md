#### Lesson 14- Exception Handling
 - 1. Explore the documentation for your compiler so that you know how to create programs which
 do not use the exception handling mechanism.
 - 2. Change the name of the file “data.txt” and run the program, notice how the program responds
 as it now cannot locate the file.
 - 3. Change the name of the file back to “data.txt”. Amend line 39 so that the second argument of
 the find average function is zero. Again, note the response of the divide by zero exception.
 - 4. Create another data file called “data2.txt”. In “data2.txt” place 6 random integers values as in
 “data.txt”. Now amend the code so that it reads in both files and adds the values in “data.txt”
 and “data2.txt” before computing the average.
 - 5. Create your own exception class which is thrown in the event that the size of the scores vector
 is less than 10 after the values have been read and stored in the scores vector. Amend the code
 to include a test for this exception and test that it works
