#### Lesson 15- Threads
 - 1. Create a “hello world” thread which executes a loop, printing to screen the message “Hello from
 Thread (handle)” 10 times. Extend the Thread class provided.
 - 2. Create a thread-safe Binary Search Tree class which uses a single lock to ensure only one thread
 at a time can insert comparable objects (this is coarse-grained locking).
 - 3. Create a thread-safe Binary Search Tree class which uses a lock-per-node so that threads can
 insert comparable objects concurrently (this is fine-grained locking).
