#### Mixing data types within a single C++ function can be achieved through several techniques, each with its own purpose and application. Here are the primary methods:
#### Function Overloading
- Function overloading allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. This is useful when you want to perform similar operations on different types.
```
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

```
#### Templates
- Templates enable you to write generic functions that can work with different data types without needing to specify the type explicitly. This is ideal for algorithms that can be applied to various types.
```
template <typename T>
T max(T a, T b) {
    return (a > b) ? a : b;
}

```
### Type Conversion
- C++ supports implicit and explicit type conversions. Implicit conversions happen automatically, while explicit conversions use casting operators. This can be used to mix types within a function if compatibility is possible.
