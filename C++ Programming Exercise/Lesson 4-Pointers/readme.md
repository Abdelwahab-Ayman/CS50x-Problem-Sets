 #### Lesson 4- Pointers
 - 1. Given that a pointer holds the value of a memory address, why is it permitted to add an integer
 data type value to a pointer variable but not a double data type?
 - 2. Suppose we have a pointer to float data type which contains the memory address value 100.
 If we add the integer value 3 to this pointer, what will be the value of the pointer if float data
 types are 4 bytes in length?
 - 3. Write a function called swap that takes two pointers to integer arguments and returns void.
 Inside the function, swap the values of the integers. Write a main function that calls this
 function and verify that the value of the integers has indeed been swapped after this function
 call.
 - 4. Pointer arithmetic can be used to access specific values when a sequence of such values exist.
 Create an array of 10 integers numbered 1 to 10 with the syntax:
 int arr[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
 Now create a function which accepts a integer pointer as its argument and returns void. Imple
ment the function to print out the even numbers of the array using pointer arithmetic.
